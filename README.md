# ArduinoWebServer
An efficient web server for the Arduino platform

This project is under devlopement, but seeks to solve issues with existing web server Arduino projects. 
Improvements include no dynamic memory (no malloc() of free()), non blocking functions, and decoupling ethernet client handling with actual webserver code.
